= Concurrent GWT

== Important Note

THIS IS A WIP ANNOTATION PROCESSOR; A LOT OF THINGS WON'T WORK AND WILL CHANGE

== About

Concurrent GWT is a WIP Java Annotation Processor that convert methods
annotated with `@ConcurrentMethod` in a class annotated with `@ConcurrentClass`
to a "cooperative threading compatible" (with explict exit and resume points),
which allows GWT's Scheduler to schedule long non-incremental tasks that would
usually hang the browser for a couple of seconds as incremental tasks that
have a fixed "running time" before it return control to the Scheduler.
